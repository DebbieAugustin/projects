# Part 1 â€“ Write a program that reads the file abespeech.txt and:

with open ('abespeech.txt', 'r') as file:
    line_number = 1 #Prints out the line number, starting at 1

    for line in file:
        line= line.rstrip() #Strips the newline
        print(line_number)
        print(line[::-1]) #Prints each line backwards
        line_number += 1


#Part 2: Write a program that reads the file smedleybutler.txt and:
#Copy all the lines that contain a word > 9 characters to a file named bigwords.txt
